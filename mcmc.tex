\section{Markov-Chain Monte Carlo}\label{sec:mcmc}

To evaluate the quality of the covariance estimates produced by our method, we used Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a benchmark for the ``true'' distribution of the logistic regression weights $(w_0, w_1, w_2)$.  We used the \texttt{R} package \texttt{MCMCpack} with an improper uniform prior, 10,000 iterations, and burn-in rate of 1,000 iterations.  We also compared to
an MCMC simulation with a normal prior on the weights $\mathcal{N}(\M{0},1000I)$ and found similar results. Figures~\ref{fig:mcmc_iterations} and \ref{fig:mcmc_iterations_normal} show the progression of the MCMC algorithm assuming each prior.

To visualize the joint distribution of the logistic regression weights, we plot the MCMC results for the values of $w_1$ and $w_2$.  In addition, we

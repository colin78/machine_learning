\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}

A recent paper by Giordano, Broderick and Jordan (2015) proposes a linear correction term derived analytically to improve the covariance estimate for MFVB.  The new proposed method is called Linear Response Variational Bayes (LRVB).  In the beginning of this project, we considered applying this new method on logistic regression and comparing its performance to the benchmark of MFVB and regular logistic regression.  However, we ran out of time to complete this phase, because implementing MFVB for logistic regression was challenging and generating the plots for the MCMC vs MFVB comparison was difficult.  In the future, we are planning to experiment with LRVB applied to variational Bayesian logistic regression, because we have majority of the most difficult work completed and now we have the source code for this method.  From this research, we hope to develop an improved version of MFVB logistic regression.
